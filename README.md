[🔗 View Project on GitHub](https://github.com/saharsh3008/yolo)

This project implements **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** — a real-time object detection system using OpenCV and a pre-trained YOLOv3 model. The system can detect multiple classes of objects in images and videos with high accuracy and speed.

## 🔍 Features

- Real-time object detection using YOLOv3
- Supports both image and video inputs
- Customizable confidence and threshold values
- Bounding boxes with labels and confidence scores
- Detects multiple objects simultaneously

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- YOLOv3 (Darknet)
- Numpy
